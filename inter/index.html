        <h2> The Pride of India's Independence Movement</h2>
        <p>
            Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, India. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule. Bose was a charismatic and influential figure who advocated for complete independence, unlike other leaders who were content with dominion status.

        <p>
            Bose was educated at Cambridge University and later joined the Indian Civil Service. However, he resigned from his position to join the Indian National Congress and fight for India's independence. He was imprisoned multiple times by the British authorities for his activities.

        <p>
            During World War II, Bose sought international support for India's independence. He formed the Azad Hind Government and the Indian National Army (INA) with the help of Axis powers. His famous slogan, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," inspired millions of Indians to join the struggle for independence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Netaji's mysterious disappearance in 1945 remains a topic of debate and speculation. His legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians.
